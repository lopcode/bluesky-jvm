# bluesky-jvm

Tools to help you build Bluesky integrations in Java, Kotlin, and JVM systems.

Used any of the tools? I'd love to hear from more users - let me know in Discussions.

Please also give the repo a star üåüÔ∏è!

## Jetstream

*Work in progress!*

A client for the Bluesky [Jetstream](https://docs.bsky.app/blog/jetstream) service.

## Samples

*Work in progress!*

Sample projects used to validate all the tools included in this repository.

Currently connects to Jetstream (specifying zstd compression), logs ~100k events, then exits.

Run with `./run_sample.sh`, example output:
```
